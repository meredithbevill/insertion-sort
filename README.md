# Insertion Sort in Java

This is a basic implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm in Java. Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

## Usage

1. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.

2. Modify the main method in the InsertionSort class to use your own array of numbers.

3. Run the program.
